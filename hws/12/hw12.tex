\qns{Independent Random Variables}\\
Find four random variables taking values in $\{-1,1\}$ so that any three are independent but all four are not.

\ifsolutions{ \answer{
Let $X_1,X_2,X_3,X_4$ be i.i.d random variables with $P(X_i=1)=P(X_i=-1)=1/2$. Let $X_4=X_1X_2X_3$. Check that $X_1,X_2,X_3,X_4$ are four random variables such that any three are independent but all four are not. For example, they are not all independent because
\[
P(X_1=1,X_2=1,X_3=1,X_4=1)=1/8 \neq
P(X_1=1)P(X_2=1)P(X_3=1)P(X_4=1)

\item Show that $\mathbb{E}[\min(X,Y)] + \mathbb{E}[\max(X,Y)] = \mathbb{E}[X] + \mathbb{E}[Y]$.


%-show that if $X$ and $Y$ are independent discrete random variables, then \[\mathbb{E}[XY] = \mathbb{E}[X] \mathbb{E}[Y].\]  Does this property imply independence?


\end{enumerate}

\qns{Variance of Random Variables} %Independent R.V.s}

The variance of a random variable tells us information about how far the random variable is spread outside its expectation. For this problem, we will use the definition $Var[X] = \exx[X^2] - \exx[X]^2$.  We already know how to compute the expectation of a sum of random variables because expectation is linear ($\mathbb{E}[X+Y] = \mathbb{E}[X] + \mathbb{E}[Y]$). In this problem, we will compute the variance of $Z$, where $Z$ is a sum of random variables:
\[ Z = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \]
%For the rest of the problem, we consider a set of random variables
and $X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_n$ are pair-wise independent (this means $\forall{i \neq} j $ Pr$[X_i = a \cap X_j = b] = Pr[X_i = a]Pr[X_j = b]$ ).
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\qpart
\item In order to compute the variance of the sum of these random variables, first  prove the following lemma: \\ \textbf{Lemma:} If $X$ and $Y$ are independent random variables, then $\exx[XY] = \exx[X] \exx[Y]$. \\ 
%Prove this lemma. 
(Hint: Let $\mathcal{X}$ be the set of all possible values of $X$ and let $\mathcal{Y}$ be the set of all possible values of $Y$. Now use the definition of expectation, $\exx[XY] = \sum\limits_{x \in \mathcal{X}} \sum\limits_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} xy \cdot Pr[X=x \cap Y = y]$).
\qpart
\item
%Let $X$ be a sum of pair-wise independent random variables. So $X = \sum\nolimits_{i=1}^n X_i$. We wish to solve for $Var[X]$. We break this into a few steps. First note that $Var[X] = \exx[X^2] - \exx[X]^2$. \\ 
Prove that $\exx[Z^2] = \sum\nolimits_{i=1}^n \exx[X_i^2] + \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j \neq i} \exx[X_iX_j]$. \\ 
(Hint: 
%Note that $X = X_1 + X_2 + \cdots X_n$.
What happens when you expand out $(X_1 + X_2 + \cdots X_n)^2$?)
\qpart
\item Prove that $\exx[Z]^2 = \sum\nolimits_{i=1}^n \exx[X_i]^2 + \sum_{i=1}^n \sum\limits_{j \neq i} \exx[X_i] \exx[X_j]$.
\qpart
\item Combine b) and c) to show $Var[Z] = \sum\nolimits_{i=1}^n \exx[X_i^2] + \sum_{i=1}^n \sum\limits_{j \neq i} \exx[X_iX_j] -  \sum\nolimits_{i=1}^n \exx[X_i]^2 - \sum_{i=1}^n \sum\limits_{j \neq i} \exx[X_i] \exx[X_j]$. Now use the lemma from part a) and rearrange to show that $Var[Z] = \sum\nolimits_{i=1}^n \exx[X_i^2] - \exx[X_i]^2$.
\qpart
\item Finally reason that $Var[Z] = Var[\sum\nolimits_{i=1}^n X_i] =    \sum\nolimits_{i=1}^n Var[X_i]$. This is true if for all $i \neq j$, $X_i$ and $X_j$ are pair-wise independent.
\qpart
\item The proof above does not hold if $X_i$ and $X_j$ are not pair-wise
  independent, because then it is possible that \\ $\exx[X_iX_j] \neq
  \exx[X_i]\exx[X_j]$ Come up with two random variables, $X$ and $Y$
  such that $Var[X+Y] \neq Var[X] + Var[Y]$. Similarly, come up with
  two random variables that are {\em not independent} but for which
  the variance of the sum is nonetheless the sum of the variances.

\end{enumerate}
  
\qns{Binomial Distribution}
In this question we will derive the Binomial Distribution. First it might help if we define the word "distribution." The distribution of a random variable specifies the probability of every possible value of that random variable. For instance, for a random variable that counts the value of a standard 6-sided die after 1 roll, the distribution is $i \in \{1,2,3,4,5,6\} \ Pr[X = i] = 1/6$. %More formally, the distribution of a discrete random variable~$X$ is the collection of values $\{(a \Pr[X=a]):a\in\Aset\}$, where $\Aset$ is the set of all possible values taken by~$X$. 
The Binomial Distribution is used to describe the number of heads that
come up when we toss a potentially biased coin (with prob $p$ of
coming up heads) $n$ times. If this sounds familiar, it's been the focus of almost all of our labs! Remember that $0 < p < 1$.
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\qpart
\item What is the probability that after $n$ trials, we see exactly
  $n$ heads? Recall that each coin flip has probability $p$ of being a
  head and different tosses of the coin are independent of each other.
\qpart
\item What is the probability that after $n$ trials, we see exactly $0$ heads?
\qpart
\item How many sequences of $n$ coin flips have exactly 1 head?
\qpart
\item How many sequences of $n$ coin flips have exactly $k$ heads? Let  $0 \leq k \leq n$ 
\qpart
\item  Let  $0 \leq k \leq n$. What is the probability of a particular
  outcome of $k$ heads occurring? For example, what is the probability
  the first $k$ trials are heads, and the rest of the trials are
  tails? Does it matter which order the heads and tails are as long as
  there are exactly $k$ heads out of exactly $n$ tosses?
\qpart
\item Combine part d and e to compute the probability that we get $k$
  heads in $n$ coin tosses. Call this Pr[$X = k$] since our random variable $X$ counts the number of heads after $n$ flips. 
\qpart
\item We have now specified the distribution of $X$ where $X$ counts
  the number of heads after $n$ flips of a biased coin with a
  probability $p$ of flipping a head. In order to prove that this is
  indeed a valid probability distribution for a random variable, we
  must verify that $\sum\nolimits_{k=0}^n Pr[X=k] = 1$. Verify that
  your distribution is valid (all the probabilities sum to 1) when
  $n=2$ and $p=1/3$.  
\qpart
\item Now we want to prove mathematically that this holds for all
  values of $n$ and $p$. The Binomial Theorem states that $(a+b)^n =
  \sum\nolimits_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k}b^k $. We will use the
  Binomial Theorem in our proof, so give a brief combinatorial
  argument to support the Binomial Theorem. Why is the coefficient of
  each term $\binom{n}{k}$? It may help to try some examples for $n=3$
  and $n=4$. 
\qpart
\item Use your result from part (h) to show that $\sum_{k=0}^n Pr[X=k] =1$ in general, where $Pr[X=k]$ is the probability you calculated in (f).
%Now plug in the correct values for $a$ and $b$ so that this looks like your equation of $\sum\nolimits_{i=1}^n Pr[X=i]$. You should be able to prove that the sum of these probabilities is indeed 1.
\qpart
\item We can say $X \sim B(n,p)$ Which is read as "$X$ is a binomial random variable with parameters $n$ and $p$. We lastly want to calculate $\mathbb{E}[X]$. An easy way to do this is to see $X$ as as sum of independent random variables. Each $X_i$ is an indicator variable that is $1$ if the $i^{\text{th}}$ flip is heads and $0$ if the $i^{\text{th}}$ flip is tails. Argue briefly that $X = \sum\nolimits_{i=1}^nX_i$.
\qpart
\item Use the linearity of expectation to calculate $\mathbb{E}[X]$.
\qpart
\item Looking at what this expectation is, remark on one empirical finding from a virtual lab or the lab we did during discussion that is explained by the expectation you just calculated. Congratulate yourself for finishing a problem by GSI lots-of-parts.

\qns{Winning the Lottery} \\ Suppose that every day, Lily buys a
lottery ticket, and will only stop buying lottery tickets when she
wins.  Let $p$ be the probability that on any given day, Lily wins the
lottery.  Let $X$ represent the totaly number of lottery tickets Lily
buys. 

\begin{enumerate}[a)]

\qpart
\item What is the probability that Lily only buys 1 lottery ticket
  (i.e. $X=1$)?  What is the probability $X=2$?  What is the
  probability $X=x$?  We can denote this $f(x)$. 
%This is the probability mass function for $X$, which we can denote $f(x)$.
Show that $f(x)$ is a proper probability mass function.

\ifsolutions{ \answer{ The probability of getting $(x-1)$ non-winning lottery tickets is $(1-p)^{x-1}$. Therefore the probability of getting $(x-1)$ non-winning tickets, then a winning ticket is
	\[ P(X=x) = (1-p)^{x-1} p. \]
	To show this is a valid probability distribution, we need to make sure the sum of $f(x)$ over all possible $x$ is 1. Using the formula for an infinite geometric series,
	\[ \sum_{x=1}^{\infty} f(x) = p \sum_{x=1}^{\infty} (1-p)^{x-1} = p \cdot \frac{1}{1-(1-p)} = 1. \]
}}\fi

\qpart
\item (Lab) Using a computer, simulate $m=10,000$ trials of Lily buying lottery tickets until she gets a winner. Use $p=0.2$, and plot a histogram with the number of lottery tickets on the $x$-axis and the fraction of trials with each of these outcomes on the $y$-axis.  Overlay $f(x)$ from part (a). What is the average number of lottery tickets Lily has to buy?

%\qpart
%\item (Lab) Now, rescale the histogram so that the sum of all the bars is 1.  Then 

\qpart
\item Compute $\mathbb{E}(X)$, the expected value of $X$. How does this relate to the average number of lottery tickets from part (b)? (Hint: use the relation $\mathbb{E}(X) = (1-p) \mathbb{E}(X) + 1$, but first explain where this relation comes from.) %What is the expected value of $X$?

%\ifsolutions{ \answer{ 
%\[ \sum_{x=0}^{\infty} x f(x) = p\sum_{x=0}^{\infty} x(1-p)^x \]
%}}\fi

\qpart
\item Compute the cumulative mass function (cmf) for $X$, $F(x) = \mathbb{P}(X \leq x)$.

\ifsolutions{ \answer{ 
	We can use the formula for a finite geometric series to find $F(x)$,
	\[ F(x) = p \sum_{y=1}^x (1-p)^{y-1} = p \cdot \frac{1 - (1-p)^x}{1 - (1-p)} = 1 - (1-p)^x. \]

\qpart
\item (Optional Lab) Use your histogram from part (b) to plot an ``empirical cmf'' (i.e. for each number of tickets $x$, plot the fraction of trials where Lily bought $x$ or fewer tickets). Then overlay $F(x)$.

\qns{007} \\
Mr.~Bond is imprisoned in a cell from which there are three possible
ways to escape: an air-conditioning duct, a sewer pipe and the door
(which is unlocked). The air-conditioning duct leads him on a two-hour
trip whereupon he falls through a trap door onto his head, much to the
amusement of his captors. The sewer pipe is similar but takes five
hours to traverse. Each fall produces amnesia and he is returned to
the cell immediately after each fall. Assume that he always
immediately chooses one of the three exits from the cell with
probability 1/3. On the average, how long does it take before he opens
the unlocked door and escapes?

Equivalent story: A certain chainsmoker is at a party. There are
three things that she can do. She can go to the bathroom, in which
case she will take two selfies (one with a cigarette, and one
without). After this, she  again has to decide what to do. Or she can
fiddle with Instagram, in which case she will take five selfies. After
which, she again has to decide what to do. Or, she can visit her
friend Jason, at which point the party ends.  When she has to decide,
she chooses equally likely between her three choices: bathroom,
Instagram, or Jason. How many selfies will she take on average at a
party? 

[HINT: Think about how to adapt the recursive trick used to calculate
the expectation of a Geometric Random Variable to this situation. ]

%In particular, you should be able to prove that $E(T) = \frac{1}{3}E(T|A) + \frac{1}{3}E(T|S) + \frac{1}{3}E(T|D)$ 

\ifsolutions{ \answer{
Using the notation in the extremely helpful hint, $E[T]=E[T\,|\, A]\Pr[A]+E[T\,|\, S]\Pr[S]+E[T\,|\, D]\Pr[D]=\frac{1}{3}(E[T\,|\, A]+E[T\,|\, S]+E[T\,|\, D])$.
Note that $E[T\,|\, A]=E[T]+2$ by the memorylessness of the situation.
Similarly, $E[T\,|\, S]=E[T]+5$. Lastly, $E[T\,|\, D]=0$ because
Mr. Bond escapes immediately. So we have that $E[T]=\frac{1}{3}(E[T]+2+E[T]+5+0)$.
Solving this for $E[T]$, we get that $E[T]=\fbox{\ensuremath{\mathbf{007}}}$.

\qns{(Optional) Balls and boxes}\\
Suppose $\alpha n$ balls are dropped at random into $n$ boxes so that all $n^{\alpha n}$ assignments have equal probability. Here, $n$ is large enough so that you can treat $\alpha n$ as a natural number. 
\begin{enumerate}[a)]

\qpart
\item Let $N$ be the number of empty boxes. Compute $E(N)$.
\qpart
\item If $X=N/n$ is the proportion of empty boxes, what are the limiting values of $E(X)$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$?

\item In a real situation, given the value of $X$, how would you estimate $\alpha$ if it is unknown?
\end{enumerate}

\ifsolutions{ \answer{
\begin{itemize}
\item[a)] $Y_i=1$ if box $i$ is empty, 0 otherwise;
\[
E(N)=E(\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i)=\sum_{i=1}^n E(Y_i)=\sum_{i=1}^n P(Y_i=1)
=\sum_{i=1}^n (\frac{(n-1)^{\alpha n}}{n^{\alpha n}}) = n(1-\frac{1}{n})^{\alpha n}
\]
\item[b)] Using the fact that 
\[
\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}(1-\frac{1}{n})^{\alpha n} = e^{\alpha}
\]

\[
E(X)=E(\frac{N}{n})=\frac{E(N)}{n}=(1-\frac{1}{n})^{\alpha n}
\]

\[\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}E(X) = e^{\alpha} \]

\item[c)]
If $n$ is large and we know $X_n$, then our estimate of $\alpha$ would be $\hat{\alpha}=logX_n$

%\end{Proof}
%
%\begin{Lemma}\label{lemma:e3-n4}
%$|E_3|=N_4$.
%\end{Lemma}
%
%\begin{Proof}
%For vertices $v_1$, $v_2$, and $v_3$ in $G_3$, the $y$-coordinate of $v_3$ is between those of $v_1$ and $v_2$ if and only if its labelled number is between those of $v_1$ and $v_2$; the $x$-coordinate of $v_3$ is between those of $v_1$ and $v_2$ if and only if its position in the permutation $\Gamma$ is between those of $v_1$ and $v_2$. For any edge $(v_1,v_2)$ in $G_3$, there is no other vertex inside or on the boundary of the bounding box of $v_1$ and $v_2$, resulting in a pair of $(i,j)$ in $\Gamma$ where there is no integer whose value is between $i$ and $j$ and whose position in $\Gamma$ is between those of $i$ and $j$. On the other hand, a pair of $(i,j)$ in $\Gamma$ where there is no integer whose value is between $i$ and $j$ and whose position in $\Gamma$ is between those of $i$ and $j$ means that there is no other vertex inside or on the boundary of the bounding box of the two corresponding vertices. As a result, $|E_3|=N_4$ due to the one-to-one mapping.
%\end{Proof}
%
%\begin{Lemma}\label{lemma:n4}
%The expected value of $N_4$ is $O(n\lg n)$.
%\end{Lemma}
%
%\begin{Proof}
%For any pair $(i,i+j)$ where $i\geq 1$, $j\geq 1$, and $i+j\leq n$, there are $(j+1)!$ permutations from $i$ to $i+j$. Among these $(j+1)!$ permutations, $(i,i+j)$ is counted if and only if $i$ and $i+j$ are permuted successively; otherwise, there is at least an integer between $i$ and $i+j$ whose position in $\Gamma$ is between positions of $i$ and $j$. Because there are $2j!$ permutations from $i$ to $i+j$ where $i$ and $i+j$ are permuted successively, and there are $n!$ permutation from 1 to $n$, the pair $(i,i+j)$ is counted $n!\frac{2j!}{(j+1)!}$ times among all permutations from 1 to $n$.
%
%Because there are $(n-j)$ types of pairs $(i,i+j)$, the total count is $\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}((n-j)n!\frac{2j!}{(j+1)!})$ among all permutations from 1 to $n$. Therefore, the expected value of $N_4$ is

% & {\textstyle { }={ }} & {\textstyle \sum_{j=1}^{n-1}\left((n-j)\frac{2}{j+1}\right)}                               \nonumber\\
%%& {\textstyle { }={ }} & {\textstyle 2\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}\left(\frac{n}{j+1}-\frac{j}{j+1}\right)}                     \nonumber\\
% & {\textstyle { }={ }} & {\textstyle 2n\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}\frac{1}{j+1}-2\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}\left(1-\frac{1}{j+1}\right)} \nonumber\\
% & {\textstyle { }={ }} & {\textstyle (2n+2)\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}\frac{1}{j+1}-2(n-1)}                                    \nonumber\\

%As a result, the expected value of $N_4$ is $O(n\lg n)$.

%\begin{Theorem}\label{theorem:edge-random-case}
%The expected number of edges in the OASG is $O(n\lg n)$.
%\end{Theorem}
%
%\begin{Proof}
%Given an instance, by Lemmas~\ref{lemma:e1-e2}, \ref{lemma:e2-e3}, and \ref{lemma:e3-n4}, the number of edges in the OASG is less than its corresponding $N_4$. By Lemma~\ref{lemma:n4}, the expected value of $N_4$ is $O(n\lg n)$. As a result, the expected number of edges in the OASG is $O(n\lg n)$ since the probability for each kind of the permutation $\Gamma$ is the same.
